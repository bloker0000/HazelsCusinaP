Both functions use Nodemailer to send professional HTML emails to both the restaurant and the customer, providing a seamless booking experience.

The site implements Vercel Analytics to track user behavior and site performance. This lightweight analytics solution is built into the Vercel platform and provides valuable insights on page views, user flow, and engagement without compromising user privacy.

## Build Process

The website uses an automated build process when deploying to Vercel:

1. JavaScript obfuscation for security
2. CSS minification for faster loading
3. HTML minification for improved performance
4. API preparation for serverless functions

Configuration is managed through `vercel.json` and `package.json` files.

## Domain & Hosting
